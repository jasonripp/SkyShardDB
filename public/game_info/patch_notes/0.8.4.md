# Patch 0.8.4
> A bunch of new suggested features and 3 new units (with a special mechanic!)

## Features:
- Hovering over a weapon now highlights its target (unless it's random)
- You can now report bugs in game! There's a new button in the pause menu when you press escape (this automatically sends your logs as well)
- The leaderboard now has rank colors and highlights your name
- Latest patch notes can now be viewed in the main menu (bottom left)
- All Enchantments now stack (except for Second Chance)
- Conditional units: new units that only appear in the shops when you have another on your board (this is an experimental test and is subject change)
- When holding space, you can now hover over every tag to highlight all your units with that tag

## Units:
- Materia Contrarium: can now split its buffs over multiple targets
- Voodoo Totem: now reflects 30% of the damage back instead of 50%
- NEW Conditional units:
  - Bot Buffer (only appears when you have Buffer Bot)
  - Toy Production (only appears when you have a Toy Store)
- New unit: Taron the Enchanter

## Bugs:
- Crashes are now fixed (unless new ones pop up)
- Defense Nature shop now correctly shows Nature units
- Prismatic mirrors can no longer loop infinitely
- Proliferator not spawning trees on start of combat
- Dragging units too fast could place them outside of the map or make them overlap
- Buffer Bot didn't work

## Other:
- There is now a public SkyShard Github repo with some cool data for everyone to use! I'll try to keep it updated and add more stuff to it, could be used to fetch all the unit stats and patch notes (if someone wants to make a website/library etc...)
